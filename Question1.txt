Q1: What happens when a file is deleted in the main branch and updated in a feature branch, and how is this handled during a merge?

A:If a file is deleted in the main branch and updated in the feature branch, 
a conflict will occur during the merge once the changes are committed. However,
the conflict won't affect the merge until the changes are committed. To resolve 
the issue, the necessary adjustments should be made in the feature branch, and 
then it can be merged into the main branch, resolving the conflict.

1- To keep the file
	If we want to keep the file with changes then add the file then commit 
	git add <file_name>
  
2 - To delete the file 
	If want to remove file like main branch remove by using command
	git rm <file_name>
