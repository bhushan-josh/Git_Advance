Q. How to set multiple remote repositories for the same project? Explain the use case. you should have a working demo of it.

A : We can set multiple remote by using below command.
git remote add <remote-name> <remote-url>

For example:

git remote add origin https://github.com/bhushan-josh/git_advance.git

git remote add git_lab https://gitlab.com/josh1395103/Multi_Repo.git

git remote -v

Use case:
1) Backup: If one remote is unavailable, we have a complete mirror of the repository on different platform.
2) Collaboration: Some collaborators might prefer different platforms.
