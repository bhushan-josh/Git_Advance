Q3: Under what conditions will Git consider a file that has been deleted as being renamed, and what criteria does Git use to determine that a new file is a renamed version of the deleted file?

A: Git considers a deleted file as being renamed if a new file with matching content
is added to the staging area. In this case, the file extension is doesnt matter as
long as the content of the files matches.
To be considered a rename, the content of the new file must match at least 50% of the deleted file's content. If the similarity is below this threshold, Git will treat the new file as a newly added file, and the deleted file will be considered removed file.
